Dear hAkkers,

The Alpakka contributors are happy to announce the release of Alpakka 3.0.0 final.

Alpakka is compatible with Akka 2.6.14+. All modules are published for Scala 2.12 and Scala 2.13.

In Alpakka 3.0.0, we no longer build against Akka 2.5.x or publish Scala 2.11 artifacts. 
Most libraries Alpakka uses are updated to their latest patch versions. 

A special thanks to [@armanbilge](https://github.com/armanbilge) for completing his rewrite of the Google Cloud BigQuery connector and introducing a new Google Common library to share cross-cutting concerns across all the Google Cloud connectors, and [@mrooding](https://github.com/mrooding) for updating many of the connectors to Akka 2.6.
