Dear hakkers,

We are happy to announce the 5.0.0 release of Akka Persistence JDBC.

## Changes since 4.0.0

This release includes a new journal schema with tags persisted on a separated table solving a long stand [issue](https://github.com/akka/akka-persistence-jdbc/issues/168).

The serialized events are not wrapped with Akka’s `PersistentRepr` as before but directly saved as a blob payload into the column using Akka's serialization mechanism. `PersistentRepr` is an internal Akka API and, although stable, it's preferable to not have them serialized into the journal, hence the change.
In addition to that, the serializer manifest is now saved on a separated column making it possible to inspect it using a simple SELECT statement.

[Replicated Event Sourcing](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/replicated-eventsourcing.html#replicated-event-sourcing) is now fully supported by the new schema.

The new schema can only be used with **new applications**. It's not yet possible to migrate an old journal to the new schema as it requires a migration tool capable of reading the serialized representation of `PersistentRepr`. That tool [doesn’t exist yet](https://github.com/akka/akka-persistence-jdbc/issues/317). However, if you have an existing journal, you can still upgrade to 5.0.0, but configure it to use the old schema, see [Migration](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-persistence-jdbc/5.0.0/migration.html).
