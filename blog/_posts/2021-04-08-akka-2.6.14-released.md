Dear hakkers,

We are pleased to announce a new patch release of Akka 2.6. This release brings an updated version of Jackson for akka-serialization-jackson to fix a security issue [#30126](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/30126).

It is possible that the Jackson upgrade from 2.10 to 2.11 is not completely source and binary compatible. We have inspected the Jackson changelogs and have not found any obvious issues. If you do use more advanced Jackson features such as custom modules where you interface with more of the Jackson APIs or have third party dependencies depending on Jackson of a different version it is important that you carefully test your application when upgrading.

Relevant Jackson release notes: 
 * [jackson-core](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/blob/jackson-core-2.11.4/release-notes/VERSION-2.x#L19-L49)
 * [jackson-annotations](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations/blob/jackson-annotations-2.11.4/release-notes/VERSION-2.x#L14-L17)
 * [jackson-dataformats-binary](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-binary/blob/jackson-dataformats-binary-2.11.4/release-notes/VERSION-2.x#L11-L48)
 * [jackson-dataformats-text](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformats-text/blob/jackson-dataformats-text-2.11.4/release-notes/VERSION-2.x#L11-L56)
 * [jackson-module-scala](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-module-scala/blob/master/release-notes/VERSION.md#version-2114)
 * `jackson-datatype-jdk8`, `jackson-datatype-jsr310` and `jackson-module-parameter-names` contain no changes between the versions.

Other noteworthy improvements in this release:

 * Possibility to stop and drain a MergeHub [#30057](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/30057), thanks [@nivox](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Anivox)
 * Initial delay for typed timers [#30065](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/30065), thanks [@nvollmar](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Anvollmar)
 * Stream attributes propagation for `Restart` operators [#24810](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/24810) and `fromMaterializer` [#30141](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/30141)

2.6.14 includes 21 closed issues. The complete list can be found on the [2.6.14 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/175?closed=1) on github.
