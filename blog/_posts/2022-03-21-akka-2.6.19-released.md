## Dropped transitive dependency on `scala-parser-combinators`

Previously, `akka-stream` contained a transitive dependency on `scala-parser-combinators`
version 1.1.2. Thanks to the contributions by [@wsargent](https://github.com/wsargent)
([#302](https://github.com/lightbend/ssl-config/pull/302)),
[@SethTisue](https://github.com/SethTisue) ([#316](https://github.com/lightbend/ssl-config/pull/316))
[@takayahilton](https://github.com/takayahilton) ([#30871](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/30871))
and [@mkurz](https://github.com/mkurz) ([#31046](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/31046))
this transitive dependency has now been dropped. This has the advantage that downstream projects
no longer need to include `scala-parser-combinators`, and when they do, they are now free to pick
either version 1.x or 2.x.

If you were using `scala-parser-combinators` in your project, but were relying on the
transitive dependency coming in from `akka-streams`, you will have to add an explicit
dependency to `scala-parser-combinators` to your project from Akka 2.6.19 onwards.

2.6.19 includes 99 closed issues. The complete list can be found on the [2.6.19 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/180?closed=1) on github.
