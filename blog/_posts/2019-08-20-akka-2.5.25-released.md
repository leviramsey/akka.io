Dear hakkers,

* Fix issue that may cause multiple active Cluster Singleton actors when several nodes leave at the same time [#27487](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/27487)

A total of 3 issues were closed since 2.5.24. The complete list can be found on the [2.5.25 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/147?closed=1) on github.
