Dear hakkers,

We are pleased to announce a new patch release of Akka 2.5. The release contains a set of smaller fixes as well as updates to make it easier for libraries to support both Akka 2.5.x and 2.6.x with the same code base.

Notable changes:

 * Configurable entry time to live for the async dns [#27578](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/27578)
 * Adapting typed actors to the akka-actor APIs with `toUntyped` has now been deprecated and `toClassic`, which is also in 2.6 should be preferred [#27650](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/27650)
 * Streams JsonFraming now allows multiple top-level arrays [#26098](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/26098) 
 * Race condition when binding artery-tcp to port 0 fixed [#27525](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/27567) 
* Potential resource leak on stopping a shard fixed [#27647](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/27647)
* Stream cancellation modes [#28008](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/28008)

A total of 18 issues were closed since 2.5.25. The complete list can be found on the [2.5.26 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/149?closed=1) on github.
