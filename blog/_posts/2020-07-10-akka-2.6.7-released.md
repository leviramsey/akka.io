## Remember Entities improvements

The Remember Entities feature of Cluster Sharding has been significantly improved, with much less overhead for tracking started and stopped entities as well as more flexibility by separating the remember entities storage from the internal Cluster Sharding state storage.

This means that it is now possible to stop using the deprecated `persistence` state store mode and switch to the default `ddata` state store mode, but still use a persistent store for remember entities. For migration details, see [migrating from deprecated persistence mode](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/cluster-sharding.html#migrating-from-deprecated-persistence-mode).

For more details about the improvements see [Remember Entities in the docs](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/cluster-sharding.html).
