Dear hakkers,

We are happy to announce the 10.2.4 and 10.1.14 releases of Akka HTTP. This release is a security fix release.

### Changes

These releases fix [CVE-2021-23339](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23339), a vulnerability regarding interpretation of `Transfer-Encoding` headers. See
[Incorrect Handling Of Transfer-Encoding Header](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/security/2021-02-24-incorrect-handling-of-Transfer-Encoding-header.html) for more information.

The vulnerability cannot be exploited using just Akka HTTP itself. Instead, Akka HTTP must be used as a proxy and the downstream server must be vulnerable itself, so
that the proxy and the downstream server disagree on how to interpret a malformed request containing both `Transfer-Encoding` and `Content-Length` headers potentially
leading to a "Request Smuggling" vulnerability. If you are using Akka HTTP as a reverse proxy, make sure to upgrade to the latest version.

Starting from this version, only a single `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header is allowed. HTTP/1.1 specifies other encodings, however, those are not supported or
implemented in Akka HTTP. Formerly, Akka HTTP would just pass on unsupported `Transfer-Encoding` headers to the user which lead to the above security issue. Since
Akka HTTP implements the "Transfer" part of the protocol, it seems reasonable to lock down allowed values for `Transfer-Encoding` to prevent security issues like this.
Please let us know if this leads to compatibility problems with your software.
