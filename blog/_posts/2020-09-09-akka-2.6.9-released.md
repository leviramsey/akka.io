Dear hakkers,

We are excited to announce a new patch release of Akka 2.6. Notable changes relative to 2.6.8 include:

* Replicated Event Sourcing a.k.a Multi-DC persistence. See below. [#29217](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/29217)
* Chunked messages in reliable delivery. Large messages sent over reliable delivery can now be chunked automatically into smaller ones. [#29560](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/29560)
* Embed types in Jackson that have existing Akka serializers. 
* Improve Shard#entityCreated API performance. [#29520](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/29217) thanks to [@mgutmanis](https://github.com/mgutmanis)

As well as some important bug fixes:

* EventSourcedBehavior un-stash causes unbounded recursion and JVM StackOverflow exceptions. [#29401](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/29401)
* Noisy logs from sharding. [#29400](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/29400)

2.6.9 includes 81 closed issues. The complete list can be found on the [2.6.9 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/169?closed=1) on github.

## Replicated Event Sourcing 

Earlier in the year [Lightbend](https://www.lightbend.com/) announced the [open sourcing of two key commercial features](https://www.lightbend.com/blog/lightbend-to-contribute-commercial-features-to-akka-open-source): Split brain resolver and Multi-DC persistence.
Rather than open sourcing the existing Multi-DC persistence library we have instead integrated the same functionality in to Akka 2.6's event sourcing APIs.
This is part of a larger effort to unify event sourcing APIs across Akka, Multi-DC persistence, and Lagom.
In addition, we've added support for running multiple replicas in the same DC and for all databases that have a persistence plugin that supports metadata. 
Shortly releases of the Apache Cassandra and Google Spanner plugins will have this support added.
JDBC has support when not using snapshots and support for snapshots will be added shortly.

This means that replicated event sourcing supports cross datacenter replication without any special support from the database. Meaning that active-active event sourcing can be
achieved even when there is no inter-dc replication at the database level e.g. independent relation databases per datacenter.

We've [released a video](https://akka.io/blog/news/2020/09/09/replicated-event-sourcing-video) describing Replicated Event Sourcing.
