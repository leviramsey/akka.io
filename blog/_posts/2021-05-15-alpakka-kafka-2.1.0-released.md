Dear hAkkers,

The Alpakka contributors are happy to announce the release of Alpakka Kafka 2.1.0 final.

Alpakka Kafka 2.1.0 uses Apache Kafka 2.7.0 and Akka 2.6 and has dropped support for Scala 2.11 releases. 
The Alpakka Kafka Testkit has had significant changes to improve Kafka testcontainers support.
Embedded Kafka is no longer available in the Testkit because it can pollute the test class path with unneeded dependencies and version conflicts.

The most notable feature of 2.1.0 is the protection against Kafka broker consumer group offset resets, by [@jyates](https://github.com/jyates).
This feature will prevent consumer group offsets from being accidentally reset to "earliest" due to several bugs in earlier versions of the Kafka broker.
To learn more read the [Unexpected consumer offset reset](https://doc.akka.io/docs/alpakka-kafka/2.1.0/errorhandling.html#unexpected-consumer-offset-reset) section of the Alpakka Kafka documentation.
