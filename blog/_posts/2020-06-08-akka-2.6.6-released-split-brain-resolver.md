Dear hakkers,

We are excited to announce a new patch release of Akka 2.6, which includes [Lightbend](https://www.lightbend.com/)'s [Split Brain Resolver](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.6/split-brain-resolver.html). Notable changes relative to 2.6.5 include:

* Split Brain Resolver is included in open source Akka Cluster. See below.
* Kubernetes friendly SSLEngine provider. See below.
* Fixes for TLS 1.3, [#29111](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/29111) and [#29110](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/29110).
* New [deployment guide for Kubernetes](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-management/current/kubernetes-deployment/index.html).
* LZ4 compression alternative for Jackson serialization, thanks to [@contrun](https://github.com/contrun), [#27066](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/27066).
* Bug fix in Cluster Sharding that could cause allocation to remain on removed node, [#29034](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/29034).
* `EventSourcedBehavior.lastSequenceNumber` was off by one in some cases, [#28976](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28976).
* Use `CBOR` in `JacksonCborSerializer` instead of `JSON`. Rolling update must go through 2.6.5 when upgrading to 2.6.6, see [Rolling Updates notes](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/project/rolling-update.html#2-6-5-jacksoncborserializer).
* Update to Protobuf 3.11.4 in Akka's internal serialization [#29014](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/29014).
* [Documentation of context propagation](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/stream-context.html) in Akka Streams.


A total of 60 issues were closed since 2.6.5. The complete list can be found on the [2.6.6 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/166?closed=1) on github.

## Split Brain Resolver

With the continued growth of Akka Cluster to power cloud native applications around the world, [Lightbend](https://www.lightbend.com/) has recognized that the timing is right to contribute the [Split Brain Resolver](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.6/split-brain-resolver.html) to the open source core of Akka.

It is important to use a correct downing provider together with for example Akka Cluster Sharding. The [Split Brain Resolver (SBR)](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.6/split-brain-resolver.html) makes the important decisions of what to do with crashed nodes, unhealthy nodes, and how to deal with network partitions.

The [Kubernetes lease](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-management/current/kubernetes-lease.html) is also released as open source and included in Akka Management 1.0.8.

Watch this [video about the Split Brain Resolver](https://akka.io/blog/news/2020/06/08/akka-split-brain-resolver-video).

## Kubernetes friendly SSLEngine provider

Akka 2.6.6 adds a new SSLEngine provider that is intended be used with Kubernetes infrastructure to facilitate distributing new certificates to pods without restarting them. Certificate rotation of Artery TCP connections is now supported without restarting the JVM. See [rotating-keys-engine in reference.conf](https://github.com/akka/akka/blob/c287fff034b598c06ef87bda78dc9851a51da94f/akka-remote/src/main/resources/reference.conf#L1178).

It also verifies that peers are part of the same Akka Cluster by comparing the subject names in the peer's certificate with the name on the own certificate.
