Dear hakkers,

We are happy to announce the 10.2.5 release of Akka HTTP. This release includes a set of performance improvements in the HTTP/2
infrastructure ultimately targeting Akka gRPC performance (more news soon).

Aside from internal improvements, some performance-related changes introduce new APIs or settings:

#### HTTP/2: Trailers on messages with Strict entities

HTTP/2 server and client can now send `Strict` entities to completely avoid stream materialization overhead for common
use cases that require no streaming. This required providing a new way to attach trailing headers to a message also for
messages with `Strict` entities. For that purpose the new attribute `AttributeKeys.trailer` of type [Trailer](https://doc.akka.io/api/akka-http/current/akka/http/scaladsl/model/Trailer.html) can be
attached to a message. This is a common scenario for gRPC which uses trailing headers to transmit the status code in a response.

Streaming entities using `Chunked` entities can still use the `LastChunk` to provide trailing headers.

See [Trailing Headers](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/server-side/http2.html#trailing-headers) for more information.

#### HTTP/2: Collect Strict entities

HTTP/2 servers can request to produce `Strict` entities also for incoming requests by using the new
`akka.http.server.http2.min-collect-strict-entity-size` setting. With that setting, the server can be instructed to
hold back an incoming request to collect more data until either the request has been fully received (`Strict` entity is
dispatched) or the given limit of collected data has been reached (`Chunked` entity is dispatched as before).
This is another optimization to avoid stream materialization overhead where possible for small requests (also common with
simple gRPC requests).

The setting is still disabled by default. See the accompanying comments in the [reference.conf](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/configuration.html#configuration)
for more information.

#### Other notable improvements

The HTTP/1.1 client connection pool has a new `keep-alive-timeout` to avoid race conditions with server-side timeouts.
See [Keep Alive Timeout](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-http/current/common/timeouts.html#keep-alive-timeout).
