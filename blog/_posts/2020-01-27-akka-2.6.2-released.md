Dear hakkers,

We are pleased to announce a new patch release of Akka 2.6. Notable changes relative to 2.6.1 include:

* New [external shard allocation strategy](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/cluster-sharding.html#external-shard-allocation). The canonical use case is to match up Kafka Partition consumption with shard locations to avoid network hops. [#28175](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28175)
* Improve performance of composite `ByteString.toArray`. [#28137](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28137)
* Streams `filter` changed behavior to eagerly filter out elements without demand from downstream. [#28467](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/28467)
* Timestamp in EventEnvelope of Persistence Query. Persistence plugins should start using it. [#28331](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28331)
* Support JDK Flight Recorder for Artery events. [#26282](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/26282)
* Fix memory leak of restarting Artery outbound stream. [#28390](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28390)
* Fix wrong logging "Marking node as REACHABLE" [#28393](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28393)
* Fix ReceiveTimeout not triggered after actor restart. [#28266](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28266)
* Fix `EventSourcedBehavior` not failing with `DeathPactException` for unhandled `Terminated` signals [#28297](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28297)
* LevelDB live persistence query stream should no complete when no events. [#28428](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28428)
* API for defining dispatcher of pool routees. Thanks to [@CodeLionX](https://github.com/CodeLionX) [#28370](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28370)
* Publish operations (events) from InmemJournal. [#28332](https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/28332)
* Update to ScalaTest 3.1.0, which means that users of `ScalaTestWithActorTestKit` in `akka-actor-testkit` need to migrate, or create their own copy of the old `ScalaTestWithActorTestKit`. [28289](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/28289).
* Update Aeron to 1.25.1 

A total of 81 issues were closed since 2.6.1. The complete list can be found on the [2.6.2 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/157?closed=1) on github.
