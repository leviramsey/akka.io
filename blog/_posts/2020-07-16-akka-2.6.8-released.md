Dear hakkers,

We are announcing Akka 2.6.8 which is a bugfix release for a regression introduced in Akka 2.6.7

A relatively serious regression bug in Akka Cluster Sharding was found [#29383](https://github.com/akka/akka/issues/29383) shortly after releasing Akka 2.6.7. 
The regression is triggered when Akka Cluster Sharding is used, and entities terminate without first passivating - this causes the complete shard to crash and other entities in the shard to be stopped until they receive their next message causing them to restart. 
Users with the Remember Entities feature enabled are not affected by this bug.

A total of 9 issues were closed since 2.6.7. The complete list can be found on the [2.6.8 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka/milestone/168?closed=1) on github.

## Credits

For this release we had the help of 5 committers – thank you all very much!
