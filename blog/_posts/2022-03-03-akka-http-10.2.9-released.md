Dear hakkers,

We are happy to announce the 10.2.9 release of Akka HTTP. This release is a bugfix release fixing a few regressions introduced with 10.2.8:

* Avoid memory leak when HTTP/2 is enabled ([#4047](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/4047))
* Revert the default behavior for ServerSentEvent parsing back to the 10.2.7 default. Empty events are now silently skipped
  again to keep compatibility with existing (akka-http) servers. If you want to interpret empty events, you can now turn
  on `akka.http.sse.emit-empty-events` ([#4043](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/4043))
* Restore compatibility with existing Lightbend Telemetry versions [#4055](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/4055)

### Changes since 10.2.8

#### akka-http-core

* Hide empty SSE events behind flag [#4043](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/4043)
* Unregister connection from MasterTermination when done [#4047](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/4047)
* Revert part of "core: cleanup some unused vals (#4033)" [#4055](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/4055)
* Silence noisy error when HTTP/2 connection is closed with idle-timeout [#4044](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/4044)

The complete list of closed issues can be found on the [10.2.9](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/milestone/69?closed=1) milestone
