Dear hakkers,

We're happy to announce the latest release candidate of Akka Projections, version 1.0.0-RC3. If no serious bug is reported this RC3 will become 1.0.0 GA next week.

We consider the API stable even though we’re still not making any bincompat promise and you should consider all the public API as ApiMayChange. It might be changed based on feedback from initial usage.

Feedback, bug reports and feature requests are welcome as issues in [akka-projection/issues](https://github.com/akka/akka-projection/issues).

Highlights of the release:

* Improved [Getting Started Guide](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-projection/current/getting-started/index.html), including examples in both Java and Scala.
* Fix off by one problem in `KafkaSourceProvider`, [#382](https://github.com/akka/akka-projection/issues/382)

The documentation can be found at [https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-projection/current/](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-projection/current/).

A total of 22 issues were closed in this release. The complete list can be found on the [1.0.0-RC3 milestone](https://github.com/akka/akka-projection/milestone/8?closed=1) on github.
