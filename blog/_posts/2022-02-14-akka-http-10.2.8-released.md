Dear hakkers,

We are happy to announce the 10.2.8 release of Akka HTTP. This release is a maintenance release, mostly fixing a few smaller issues around HTTP/2 support.

Akka HTTP now also supports graceful termination for HTTP/2 servers. If coordinated shutdown is enabled for a server binding
via `ServerBinding.addToCoordinatedShutdown`, the server will allow ongoing requests to be completed for a configurable
period of time while immediately rejecting incoming requests before shutting down the application process.
This helps to avoid downtime during rolling upgrades.
