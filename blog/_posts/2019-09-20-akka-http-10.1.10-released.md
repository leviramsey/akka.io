Dear hakkers,

We are happy to announce the 10.1.10 release of Akka HTTP. This release is the tenth update in the 10.1.x series of Akka HTTP.

### Migration notes

[RFC 7231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-6.3.6) dictates an HTTP response with status code 205 ('Reset Content') is not allowed to have an entity body. Since [#2686](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/pull/2686) we enforce this restriction, so if you (incorrectly) produced such responses you will have to either remove the entity body or select a different status code.

### Changes since 10.1.9
